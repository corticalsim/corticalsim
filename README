BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Compilers:
CorticalSim is coded in C++ and can be compiled using common C++ compilers, including GNU g++, Apple LLVM and Microsoft Visual Studio.

Dependencies:
The code makes use of C++ boost libraries. The relevant libraries can be found, for example, in the libboost-all-dev package for Ubuntu-based Linux distributions. 

The compilation requires the BOOST_ROOT environment variable to point to the 
On Linux systems, this can be achieved using the command:
	export BOOST_ROOT=“[full path to boost libraries]”

Compilation:
On Linux and OSX/macOS, g++ compilation is invoked using the ‘make’ command. 
‘make release’ creates a release version
‘make debug’ creates a debug version
‘make clean’ removes build files
‘make cleanmore’ removes build and output files
The executable is named corticalSim.release / corticalSim.debug [according to build preference]

On Windows, use Microsoft Visual Studio to open the file VC++\corticalSim.sln. The executable corticalSim.exe is created in the directory VC++\debug or VC++\release, according to the build preference.

The program has been successfully tested under gcc (v11.4.0) on Linux Mint (v21.3), and gcc (v9.4.0) on Linux Mint (v20.2).

Notes:
The code depends on "old" C++ standards for several elements of std:: namespace. gnu compiler flags contain the correct reference to this.
